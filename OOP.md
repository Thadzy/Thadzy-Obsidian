## Introduction 
Object-Oriented Programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

>What is the variable_ the "_" after the variable in private opp in cpp what does it means?

In C++ (especially in **Object-Oriented Programming**, or OOP), using a trailing underscore (e.g., `variable_`) in **private member variables** is a **naming convention**, not a language feature. It has **no functional meaning to the compiler**, but it serves an important purpose for **code readability and maintainability**.

### Meaning of `variable_` (trailing underscore)
- `variable_` indicates that the variable is a **private member of a class**.
- It helps distinguish member variables from local variables or parameters, especially in constructors or setters.
