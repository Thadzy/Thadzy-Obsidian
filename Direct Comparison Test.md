[[Infinite Series]] 
## Introduction 
The Direct Comparison Test (DCT) is a method to determine whether an infinite series converges or diverges by comparing it to a second series with known convergence behavior. 
$$b_n \geq a_n > 0$$
1. $\Sigma b_n$ => C, $\Sigma a_n$ => C
2. $\Sigma a_n$ => D, $\Sigma b_n$ => D

Then use p-series or geometric series
## Step
1. Divided to an and bn $n^p$
2. p-series of geometric series $r^n$
