**Is it necessary to select a contact point to calculate the slope?**
*Ans* No because in finding the slope of the graph just use $\Delta$ to 2 points to find the Tangen line by select the 2 points of the slope and find m

**How to select that 2 points?**
*Ans*

## Visualization the movement of the particle

**At t = 20 Does the particle return?**
*Ans* yes 

## Solution
### Wording
- Speed
- Velocity
**What is the different of these 2 words**
*Ans* Speed use distance it is Scalar, But Velocity use displacement is the vector
