**Is it necessary to select a contact point to calculate the slope?**
*Ans* No because in finding the slope of the graph just use $\Delta$ to 2 points to find the Tangen line by select the 2 points of the slope and find m

**How to select that 2 points?**
*Ans*

## Visualization the movement of the particle

**At t = 20 Does the particle return?**
*Ans* yes 

## Solution
### Wording
- Speed
- Velocity
**What is the different of these 2 words**
*Ans* **Speed**Â is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time. It is a scalar quantity,
But **Velocity**, on the other hand, refers to the rate of change of displacement, which includes both magnitude and direction. It is a vector quantity,
**Speed** $$\frac{Distance}{Time}$$
**Velocity** $$\frac{Displacement}{Time}$$
**If we want to find the average speed over any time period, how do we do it? For example, if we want to find the average speed over a period of 10 to 15 seconds?**
*Ans* Use $\Delta$

**How does the word moment affect the time period we consider?**
*Ans*
