**Is it necessary to select a contact point to calculate the slope?**
*ANS* No because in finding the slope of the graph just use $\Delta$ to 2 points to find the Tangen line by select the 2 points of the slope and find m

**How to select that 2 points?**
**ANS**

## Visualization the movement of the particle
