**Is it necessary to select a contact point to calculate the slope?**
*Ans* No because in finding the slope of the graph just use $\Delta$ to 2 points to find the Tangen line by select the 2 points of the slope and find m

**How to select that 2 points?**
*Ans* ...

## Visualization the movement of the particle

**At t = 20 Does the particle return?**
*Ans* yes 

## Solution
### Wording
- Speed
- Velocity
**What is the different of these 2 words**
*Ans* **Speed** is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time. It is a scalar quantity,
But **Velocity**, on the other hand, refers to the rate of change of displacement, which includes both magnitude and direction. It is a vector quantity,
**Speed** $$\frac{Distance}{Time}$$
**Velocity** $$\frac{Displacement}{Time}$$
**If we want to find the average speed over any time period, how do we do it? For example, if we want to find the average speed over a period of 10 to 15 seconds?**
*Ans* Use $\Delta$

**What does at any given moment mean? For example t = 15**
*Ans* Just like the $\Delta$ But $\lim_{x \to 0}$ in small time --> Calculus 

**Average speed = instantaneous speed or not?**
*Ans* No because Average speed is all the speed has one value but the instantaneous speed also the 1 value at the specific moment in time.

### How to
1. Close 2 points $\Delta t \to 0$
2. Find $\Delta X, \Delta T$
3. V = $\frac{\Delta X}{\Delta T}$ but $\Delta T \to 0$
4. V = $\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta X}{\Delta T}$ = $\frac{dx}{dt}$

### Wording
**Distance** is the total length of the path traveled by an object, regardless of direction. It is a scalar quantity
**Displacement**, on the other hand, is the shortest straight-line distance from the initial position to the final position of an object.

## Accele## **Turning point**
Turning point is the $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$ (v = 0) is the particle still have the speed it's can't return
**What if particle have speed can it return?**ration
Tell how fast the speed is changing
$$ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt}$$ 
## **Turning point**
Turning point is the $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$ (v = 0) is the particle still have the speed it's can't return
**What if particle have speed can it return?**
*Ans* ...
