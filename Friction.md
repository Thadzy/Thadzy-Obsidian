## Introduction 
**friction**, [force](https://www.britannica.com/science/force-physics) that resists the sliding or rolling of one [solid](https://www.britannica.com/science/solid-state-of-matter) object over another. Frictional forces

**Is it real the friction always the opposite direction with direction of movement?**
*Ans* Not always for example the carpet case friction will make the object move above the carpet friction will resisting the effort of movement 
**Is it real? if the object doesn't move there is no friction?**
*Ans* No if we push the object and it's doesn't move therefor friction is doing with the object force net = 0
**How to find the size of friction?**
*Ans* Object doesn't slip $f_{s} = \mu_{s} N$ and Newton law
if the object slip $f_{k} = \mu_{k} N$

$$\mu_k = \frac{f_k}{N} = \frac{force}{force}$$
There is no unit
## How to solve the problem
1. Identify all forces acting.
2. Observe the direction movement to do the coordination
3. use Newton's laws
