## Introduction 
is the product between 2 vectors that output third vector that will be perpendicular to A and B
$$\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} =\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ A_x & A_y & A_z \\ B_x & B_y & B_z \end{vmatrix}$$

```
If θ = 0, θ = 180 vectors are parallel, and the cross product is zero
If θ = 90, vectors are perpendicular
```
