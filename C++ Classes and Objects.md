## Introduction 
Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an **object**. The car has **attributes**, such as weight and color, and **methods**, such as drive and brake.

Attributes and methods are basically **variables** and **functions** that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".

A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
