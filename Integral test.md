[[Infinite Series]]
## Introduction 
The integral test is a method to determine whether an infinite series converges or diverges by comparing it to an improper integral. 

$$\int_1^\infty f(x)dx = N = Converge$$

$$\int_1^\infty f(x)dx = \infty = Diverge$$
## 3 Rules
1. Positive?
2. Continuous?
3. Decreasing? (Taking the first Derivative)
4. Take limit and Integral
$$\lim_{b\to\infty}\int_1^bf(x)dx$$
If it's has value = converge
else = diverge
