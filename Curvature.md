## Introduction 
As we see this T since P1 â†’ P2 has a little changed but P3 is very much so we will use **The rate of change of the tangent vector is 1 unit compare with s to tell the Curvature (C)**
<aside> ðŸ’¡

Because of Unit tangent vector doesnâ€™t change the volume but change only direction

**K is Kappa**

$$ K(s) = |\frac{dT}{ds}| = |r''(s)| $$

$$ K(t) = |\frac{dT}{ds}| = \frac{1}{|v|}|\frac{dT}{ds}| = \frac{T'(t)}{r'(t)} $$

$$ K(t) = \frac{|r'(t) \times r''(t)|}{|r'(t)|^3} = \frac{|v(t) \times a(t)|}{|v(t)^3|} $$
