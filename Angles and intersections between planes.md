## Introduction 
Angle between plane = angle between normal vector of two planes act on each other

$$ cos \theta = \frac{N_1 \cdot N_2}{|N_1||N_2|} $$

$$ \theta = cos^{-1}\frac{N_1 \cdot N_2}{|N_1||N_2|} $$


Two planes if not parallel, always intersect; $N_1 \times N_2$ is the vector parallel with the two planes.
