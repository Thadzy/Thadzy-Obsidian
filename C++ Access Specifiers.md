## Introduction 
The `public` keyword is an **access specifier.** Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. In the example above, the members are `public` - which means that they can be accessed and modified from outside the code.
```
In C++, there are three access specifiers:
- `public` - members are accessible from outside the class
- `private` - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
- `protected` - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, 
```
