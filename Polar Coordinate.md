## Introduction 
![[Pasted image 20250421110832.png]]
Is the point in the plane located by using distance from the pole and an angle from the reference direction (the polar axis) 
$$(r, \theta)$$
> Why use Polar Coordinate
>> Use to simplify the problem in circular or rotation in Physics or Engineering Ex. GPS use to determine locations base on distance and direction from the reference point

```
if -r direction is opposite
```
