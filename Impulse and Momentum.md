# Momentum
## Introduction 

is a quantity that describes an object's resistance to stopping (a kind of "moving inertia"). -> tell the state of moving object
$$p = mv$$
### [[Kinematics]] 
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\frac{m}{m}$$
$p = mv$ thus; 
$$KE = \frac{p^2}{2m}$$

**Kinematics in system is decreased because it's change to heat or GPE or something**
### Momentum changed
$$\Sigma F = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}$$

=
$$\Delta P = (\Sigma F)(\Delta t)$$
Momentum changed =  Net force x time of force action => **Impulse**
**The total momentum of the system is constant and does not change.**

# Impulse
is a quantity that describes the effect of a net force acting on an object (a kind of "moving force").
$$J = F\Delta t$$
# Collision
When one object hits another object in a short period of time.

## **Elastic Collision**
- The shape of the objects does not change, and the total kinetic energy is conserved.
	- **Perfectly Elastic Collision**: No loss of kinetic energy; examples include billiard balls.
	- **Imperfectly Elastic Collision**: Some kinetic energy is lost, often converted into other forms like heat or sound.
## **Inelastic Collision**
- The shape of the objects changes, or they stick together. Kinetic energy is not conserved.
- Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy decreases as it is converted into other forms like deformation or heat.
## **Explosions**
- Objects break apart or separate without external forces.
- Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy increases as other forms of energy are converted into kinetic energy.
	- **Explosion by Separation**: Objects separate into parts, such as shooting a gun.
	- **Relative Explosion**: Objects remain connected but move relative to each other, such as a person walking on a boat.
## Law of Conservation of Momentum
The **Law of Conservation of Momentum** states that in an isolated system, the total momentum remains constant if no external forces act upon it. This principle is fundamental in physics and can be expressed mathematically as:
$$m_1u_1+m_2u_2=m_1v_1+m_2v_2$$

## [[Relative speed]]

$$∣u_A​−u_B​∣=∣v_B​−v_A​∣$$
# Coefficient of restitution
The **coefficient of restitution (COR)** is a measure of how elastic a collision is between two bodies.
- **e=1**: This indicates a **perfectly elastic collision**, where no kinetic energy is lost, and the objects rebound with the same speed they approached each other.
- **e=0**: This represents a **perfectly inelastic collision**, where the objects do not rebound at all and stick together after the impact.

$$v = eu$$

Before A = 10 B = 3 -> therefore B = 10-3 = 7 <-
After A = 8 B = 12 -> therefore B = 12-4 = 4 ->
Therefore e = 4/7

# Impulse-Momentum Theorem
The impulse-momentum theorem states that the change in momentum of an object equals the impulse applied to it.
