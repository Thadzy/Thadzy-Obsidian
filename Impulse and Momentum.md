# Momentum
## Introduction 

is a quantity that describes an object's resistance to stopping (a kind of "moving inertia"). -> tell the state of moving object
$$p = mv$$
### [[Kinematics]] 
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\frac{m}{m}$$
$p = mv$ thus; 
$$KE = \frac{p^2}{2m}$$

Kinematics in system is decreased because it's change to heat or GPE or something
### Momentum changed
$$\Sigma F = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}$$
=
$$\Delta P = (\Sigma F)(\Delta t)$$
Momentum changed =  Net force x time of force action => **Impulse**
**The total momentum of the system is constant and does not change.**
# Collision
When one object hits another object in a short period of time.
## Elastic collision
An **elastic collision** is defined as a type of collision where both **momentum** and **kinetic energy** are conserved. This means that after the collision, the total kinetic energy of the colliding bodies remains the same, with no net loss or conversion of energy into other forms, such as heat or sound

## Law of Conservation of Momentum
The **Law of Conservation of Momentum** states that in an isolated system, the total momentum remains constant if no external forces act upon it. This principle is fundamental in physics and can be expressed mathematically as:
$$m_1u_1+m_2u_2=m_1v_1+m_2v_2$$

## [[Relative speed]]

$$∣u_A​−u_B​∣=∣v_B​−v_A​∣$$
## Coefficient of restitution
The **coefficient of restitution (COR)** is a measure of how elastic a collision is between two bodies.
- **e=1**: This indicates a **perfectly elastic collision**, where no kinetic energy is lost, and the objects rebound with the same speed they approached each other.
- **e=0e=0**: This represents a **perfectly inelastic collision**, where the objects do not rebound at all and stick together after the impact.

$$v = eu$$

Before A = 10 B = 3 -> therefore B = 10-3 = 7 <-
After A = 8 B = 12 -> therefore B = 12-4 = 4 ->
Therefore e = 4/7

**How They Relate**:
- **Impulse and Momentum**: Impulse directly relates to momentum because it represents the change in momentum. When a net force acts on an object for a certain amount of time, it changes the object's momentum. For example, *when you kick a ball, the force of your foot (impulse) changes the ball's momentum.*
- **Momentum and Kinetic Energy**: While both momentum and kinetic energy depend on mass and velocity, they describe different aspects of motion. Momentum is a vector quantity (it has direction), while kinetic energy is a scalar quantity (it does not have direction).
- **Energy Transformation**:
- When a force acts on an object (impulse), it can change the object's kinetic energy. For example, in a collision, if one object loses momentum, that momentum is transferred to another object, resulting in a change in kinetic energy for both objects.
- In inelastic collisions, some kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy (like heat or sound), demonstrating how energy can change forms during interactions.
