First principle Impulse and Momentum $\Sigma F \Delta t = \Delta p$
if net force of the system = o, momentum of system will be the same
$$\Delta P_x + \Delta P_y = 0$$
But $$P_x + P_y = Constant$$
Momentum P tell the state of moving object
KE will be the energy in moving object
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\frac{m}{m}$$
$p = mv$
$$KE = \frac{p^2}{2m}$$

KE in system is decreased because it's change to heat or EPE
**How do we know there are net force acting with box Y?**
*Ans* Because I know force net = rate of change of momentum, Y has the changing momentum
$$\Sigma F = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}$$
=
$$\Delta P = (\Sigma F)(\Delta t)$$
Momentum changed =  Net force x time of force action => **Impulse**
**The total momentum of the system is constant and does not change.**
## Elastic collision
An **elastic collision** is defined as a type of collision where both **momentum** and **kinetic energy** are conserved. This means that after the collision, the total kinetic energy of the colliding bodies remains the same, with no net loss or conversion of energy into other forms, such as heat or sound

## Law of Conservation of Momentum
The **Law of Conservation of Momentum** states that in an isolated system, the total momentum remains constant if no external forces act upon it. This principle is fundamental in physics and can be expressed mathematically as:
$$m_1u_1+m_2u_2=m_1v_1+m_2v_2$$

## Relative speed
![[Pasted image 20241023141051.png]]
$$∣u_A​−u_B​∣=∣v_B​−v_A​∣$$
## Coefficient of restitution
The **coefficient of restitution (COR)** is a measure of how elastic a collision is between two bodies.
- **e=1**: This indicates a **perfectly elastic collision**, where no kinetic energy is lost, and the objects rebound with the same speed they approached each other.
- **e=0e=0**: This represents a **perfectly inelastic collision**, where the objects do not rebound at all and stick together after the impact.

$$v = eu$$

Before A = 10 B = 3 -> therefore B = 10-3 = 7 <-
After A = 8 B = 12 -> therefore B = 12-4 = 4 ->
Therefore e = 4/7
