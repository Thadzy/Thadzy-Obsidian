## Introduction 
The Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms derived from its derivatives at a specific point aa. It is expressed as:

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x - a)^n$$
$$= f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!} (x - a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!} (x - a)^3 + \dots$$
