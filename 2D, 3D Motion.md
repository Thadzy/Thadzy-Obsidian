## Introduction
2D and 3D motion refer to the change in position or orientation of a body over time. Motion can be classified into different types, including translational motion (see more in [[Kinematics]]). It also involves [[Vectors]] to represent direction and includes concepts such as [[Circular Motion]] and [[Projectile Motion]].

## Equation
$$ v = \frac{d}{dt}r = \frac{d}{dt}(xi + yj) = \frac{d}{dt}(xi)+\frac{d}{dt}(yj)$$
$$= i\frac{dx}{dt}+ j \frac{dy}{dt} $$
$$ v = v_xi + v_yi $$
$$ v_x = \frac{dx}{dt}, v_y = \frac{dy}{dt}$$
$$v = \sqrt{v_i^2+v_j^2}$$
$$Î¸ = tan^{-1}(\frac{v_i}{v_j})$$
**Everything is similar to 1D motion but divided into calculations across 2 or 3 axes.**
