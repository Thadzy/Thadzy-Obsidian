It's vector
## How to calculate?
$$ v = \frac{d}{dt}r = \frac{d}{dt}(xi + yj) = \frac{d}{dt}(xi)+\frac{d}{dt}(yj)$$
$$= i\frac{dx}{dt}+ j \frac{dy}{dt} $$
$$ v = v_xi + v_yi $$
$$ v_x = \frac{dx}{dt}, v_y = \frac{dy}{dt}$$
$\Delta r = vt$ Why? 
Because V is constant so v = $\frac{Displacement}{Time}$
## How to draw the vector
### Do the Pythagorean
$$v = \sqrt{v_i^2+v_j^2}$$
### Do Arctan
**Why arctan?**
*Ans* The arctangent function is specifically suited for this purpose because it relates the opposite side (vertical component vjvj​) to the adjacent side (horizontal component vivi​) of a right triangle formed by these components. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as:
$$θ = tan^{-1}(\frac{v_i}{v_j})$$

## First way to find a
t = 2, 2.1 to find v
$$a_{ll} = \frac{v - u}{t} $$
## Second way to find a
Prediction 
1. V increasing because of $a_{ll}$ has the same direction with v
2. acceleration $a_p$ make the particle move circular
