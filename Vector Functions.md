## Introduction 
a mathematical function of one or more variables whose range is a set of multidimensional vectors or infinite-dimensional vectors.
$$ r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)i + z(t)k $$

- r(t) is function vector of t
- x(t), y(t), z(t) is component of r(t)

## Might useful example

$$ r(t) = 2costi + 2sintj + tk $$
