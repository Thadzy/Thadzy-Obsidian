## Introduction 
A projectile is any object thrown into space upon which the only acting force is gravity.

Only force that effect to the projectile is mg it's use velocity to move
$$mg = ma$$
$$a = g$$
```
Therefor projectile is freefall with acceleration
```
## Horizontal Motion
The horizontal motion occurs at a constant velocity since there are no horizontal forces acting on the projectile (neglecting air resistance):

$$
x = v_{0x} t
$$

where

$$
v_{0x} = v_0 \cos(\theta)
$$

is the horizontal component of the initial velocity.
## Vertical Motion

The vertical motion is influenced by gravity and can be described by the following equations:

#### Vertical Displacement:

$$
y = v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$

where

$$
v_{0y} = v_0 \sin(\theta)
$$

is the vertical component of the initial velocity.

#### Time of Flight:

The time of flight until the projectile reaches the ground is calculated as:

$$
T = \frac{2v_{0y}}{g} = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
$$
