**How many force did to the projectile**
*Ans* 1. mg 
$$mg = ma$$
$$a = g$$
Therefor projectile is freefall with acceleration

## Horizontal Motion

- The horizontal motion occurs at a constant velocity since there are no horizontal forces acting on the projectile (neglecting air resistance):
    
	$x = ut$
    
    where $v_{0x} = v_0 cos\theta$  is the horizontal component of the initial velocity.

## Vertical Motion

- The vertical motion is influenced by gravity and can be described by the following equations:
    
    - **Vertical Displacement**:
        
        $y = ut- \frac{1}{2}t^2$
        
        where $y_{0x} = v_0 cos\theta$ is the vertical component of the initial velocity.
    - **Time of Flight**:  
        The time of flight until it reaches the ground can be calculated as:
        
        T=2v0yg=2v0sin⁡(θ)gT=g2v0y​​=g2v0​sin(θ)​
