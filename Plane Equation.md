## Introduction 
Plane is the set of point (x,y,z) according to equation Ax+By+Cz+D = 0

$$ a(x−x0)+b(y−y0)+c(z−z0)=0 $$

- A,B,C are the components of a vector to the plane
- (x,y,z) are the coordinates of any point on the plane
- D is a constant that determines the position of the plane

The key concept is
It uses position vector and perpendicular concepts is

**Position vector concept**

$$ P_0P $$

**Perpendicularity Condition**

$$ N \cdot P_0P = 0 $$

**Therefore, N = (a,b,c), P = x-x0**
$$a(x−x0)+b(y−y0)+c(z−z0)=0$$
