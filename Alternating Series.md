## Introduction 
a series where the signs of the terms alternate between positive and negative.
$$\Sigma_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n*\frac{1}{n} = -1 + \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+...$$
## Conditions
1. $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0$ 
2. $a_n + 1 <= a_n$ => Has to be decreasing
then converge use p-series or geomatric

Take only positive
