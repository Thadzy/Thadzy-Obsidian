## Introduction 
Circular motion is the movement of object move along the circumference of a circle It can be uniform with a constant rate of rotation and constant tangent speed

**Why v is not constant?**
*Ans* Because u != v even through size is the same but different direction
## Properties of circle
- Circle has 360 = 2Ï€ rad
- Time use 1 round = period (T)
- $f = \frac{1}{T}$
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$
## Linear Speed 

$$v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} => v = \omega r$$
## Angular Velocity
Angular Velocity is a measure of how quickly an object rotates around a central point or axis.

$$\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$
## Centripetal acceleration
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r $$
