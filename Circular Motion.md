## Introduction 
Circular motion is the movement of object move along the circumference of a circle there are more 1 axis so it's is [[2D, 3D Motion]] and [[Vector]] represent the direction but even though it's the same size but different direction it's not equal.

## Properties of circle
- Circle has 360 = 2Ï€ rad
- Time use 1 round = period (T)
- $f = \frac{1}{T}$
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$
## Linear Speed 
is the rate at which an object travels along a straight path

$$v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} => v = \omega r$$
## Angular Velocity
Angular Velocity is a measure of how quickly an object rotates around a central point or axis. It describes how quickly an object completes one full rotation.

$$\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$
> What is the different between v and w?
>> Linear speed measure how fast a point moves along the circular path but Angular velocity tell how fast is the object will complete one full rotation

## Centripetal acceleration
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r $$
