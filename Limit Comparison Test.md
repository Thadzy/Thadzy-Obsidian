[[Infinite Series]]
## Introduction
The **Limit Comparison Test** (LCT) is a convergence test for infinite series that determines whether two series with positive terms share the same convergence behavior by analyzing the limit of their term ratios.
$a_n > 0$
$b_n > 0$
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} (\frac{a_n}{b_n}) = L$$
$$\Sigma a_n , \Sigma b_n$$ will Converge and Diverge together 
1. $\lim_{n\to\infty}|\frac{a_n}{1}*\frac{1}{b_n}|$
2. Simplify 
3. Take limit
