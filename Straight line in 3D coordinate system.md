## Introduction 
Give the line L pass the point P_0(x_0,y_0,z_0) and parallel with the vector v
![[Pasted image 20250414124232.png]]
Therefore, every point in P(x,y,z) on line L will have the real number t that makes :

$$ P_0P = tv $$

- $P_0P$ is the distance between $P_0$ to any P
- v give the direction of the line
- t is the scalar

$$ or (x-x_0,y-y_0,z-z_0)=(ta,tb,tc) $$

Pipeline

1. Start at Point $P_0$
2. Vector v shows which way it goes
3. By scaling t to v to make it reach the point $P_0$ </aside>

In other words, itâ€™s called

## Parametric Equation

use to describe the path of an object

$$ x = x_0 + at $$

$$ y = y_0 +bt $$

$$ z = z_0 + ct $$

- v is the direction vector of line L
- a,b,c is the direction number

we call the equation of L in

$$ \frac{x-x_0}{a}=\frac{y-y_0}{b}=\frac{z-z_0}{c} $$

and a,b,c â‰  0 we called symmetric equation
