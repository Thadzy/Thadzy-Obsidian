# Derivative of Exponential and Logarithms
![[Pasted image 20250628142152.png]]
$$\ln a = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{a^h-1}{h} $$
$$\frac{d}{dx}2^x=2^x\ln2$$
Therefore the derivative of Exponential is 
$$\frac{d}{dx}b^x= b^x\ln b$$
## Derivative of e
we know that $\frac{d}{dx}b^x= b^x\ln b$ therefore when derivative of e 
$$\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e \ln e$$
while $lne = 1$ bacause e^1 = e
log_b b = 1 because b^1 = b
