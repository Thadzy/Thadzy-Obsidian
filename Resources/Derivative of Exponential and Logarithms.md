## Derivative of Exponential

$$\ln a = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{a^h-1}{h} $$
$$\frac{d}{dx}2^x=2^x\ln2$$
Therefore the derivative of Exponential is 
$$\frac{d}{dx}b^x= b^x\ln b$$
if there is
$$\frac{d}{dx}b^{f(x)} = f'(x) \ln b^{fx}$$
## Derivative of e
we know that $\frac{d}{dx}b^x= b^x\ln b$ therefore when derivative of e 
$$\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e \ln e^x$$
while $\ln e = 1$ because $e^1 = e$
$log_b b = 1$ because $b^1 = b$
therefore derivative of e
$$\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x$$

## Derivative of Logarithms


# Cues
**Why ln e = 1?**
**Ans**  Because the logarithm tells you **"what power must I raise e to get e?"**
