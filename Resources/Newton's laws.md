# Newton's laws
1. Newton’s First Law of Motion (**Inertia**) 
	1. An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
	2. $$\Sigma F = 0$$
2. Newton’s Second Law of Motion (**Force**)
	2. The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.
	3. $$\Sigma F = ma$$
3. Newton’s Third Law of Motion (**Action & Reaction**)
	 3. Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.
	 4. $$Action = Reaction$$
# Cues
**Why force = accelerate not velocity?**
**Ans** because velocity is constant due to inertia object keeps moving
but acceleration force is thing that change velocity
# Summary
```
Newton's 3 laws
1. Object at rest remains at rest and object in motion remains in motion unless acted by an unbalanced force
2. Force = mass x accelerate
3. Action = Reaction
