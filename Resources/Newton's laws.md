# Newton's laws
1. Newton’s First Law of Motion (**Inertia**) 
	1. An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
	2. $$$$
2. Newton’s Second Law of Motion (**Force**)
	2. The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.
3. Newton’s Third Law of Motion (**Action & Reaction**)
	 3. Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.
