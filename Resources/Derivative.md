# Derivative
Derivative is the rate of change or slope of the function
## Average Rate of Change
we can find the average rate of change by

$$\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}$$
## Instantaneous Rate of Change
what if I want to find velocity at t = 1.5s?

$$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

| Name             | Average Rate of Change | Instantaneous Rate of Change |
| Represents       | Slope of secant line   | Slope of tangent line        |
| Uses two points? | Yes                    | No (limit to a single point) |
| Accuracy         | Approximate            | Exact at a point             |

# Cues
What is the different of Differential and Derivative?
Ans 
- Derivative How fast is y changing at this exact point of x?
- Differential If x changes by a small amount dx, how much does y approximately change?
# Summary
```
This is the derivertive by definition by using limit there are 2 types average (secant line) and instantaneous (tangent line)
