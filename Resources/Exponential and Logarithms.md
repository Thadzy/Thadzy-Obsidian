# Exponential and Logarithms
## Exponential
An exponential function has the form $a^x$, where 𝑎a is a constant; examples are $2^x$, $10^x$, $e^x$ The logarithmic functions are the **inverses** of the exponential functions

There are 3 cases
1. b > 1 increase
2. b = 1 flat
3. b < 2 decay

## e
e = 2.7182818284590452353602874713527...
$$y = e^x$$
$$x = log_e(y)$$
$$x = ln(y)$$
ln is log base e call natural logarithm
# Cues
What if I don't have calculator how can I find logarithms?
# Summary
```
Not Finished but This is tell about the exponential and logarithms and lastly e I will back to learn it more
