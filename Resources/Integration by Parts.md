# Integration by Parts
use to find the derivative of function that use  product rule
![[Pasted image 20250628172752.png]]
therefore when simplify
$$\int u dv = uv-\int v du$$
e.g.![[Pasted image 20250628172948.png]]
step 
1. Find u
2. Derivative u (du)
3. Find dv 
4. Integrate dv (v)

# Cues
**There are anyway to choose u and dv?**
**Ans** LIATE
# Summary
```
Integration by parts use when Integrate the derivative of product rule by split integrate part by part by choose
