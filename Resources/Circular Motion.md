# Circular Motion
is a motion of object moving rotating along circular path
## Properties of circle
- Circle has 360 = 2π rad
- Time use 1 round = period (T)
- $f = \frac{1}{T}$
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$

## Angular Displacement
is an angle turn by rotating object per time
![[Pasted image 20250621162628.png]]
$$\theta = \frac{s}{r}$$
## Angular Velocity
is rate of change in angular displacement call $\omega$ (rad/s)
$$w = \frac{\theta}{t}$$
and $\theta = \frac{s}{r}$ 
$$\omega = \frac{\frac{s}{r}}{t}$$ and $v = \frac{s}{t}$
$$\omega = \frac{v}{r}$$
## Linear Velocity
is tangential speed telling rate of change in straight.
$$v = \omega r$$
## Angular Acceleration (α)
Angular acceleration α is the rate of change of angular velocity over time.
$$\alpha=\frac{d\omega}{dt}$$
or we can use SUVAT to calculate it 
$$\alpha = \frac{\}{}$$


# Cues
if object not moving along circular path but have the centripetal acceleration it's still call circular motion?
