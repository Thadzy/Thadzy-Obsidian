# Circular Motion
is a motion of object moving rotating along circular path
## Properties of circle
- Circle has 360 = 2Ï€ rad
- Time use 1 round = period (T)
- $f = \frac{1}{T}$
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$

## Angular Displacement


# Cues
if object not moving along circular path but have the centripetal acceleration it's still call circular motion?
