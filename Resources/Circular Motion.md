# Circular Motion
is a motion of object moving rotating along circular path
## Properties of circle
- Circle has 360 = 2π rad
- Time use 1 round = period (T)
- $f = \frac{1}{T}$
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$

## Angular Displacement
is an angle turn by rotating object per time

$$\theta = \frac{s}{r}$$
## Angular Velocity
is rate of change in angular displacement call $\omega$ (rad/s)
$$w = \frac{\theta}{t}$$
and $\theta = \frac{s}{r}$ 
$$\omega = \frac{\frac{s}{r}}{t}$$ and $v = \frac{s}{t}$
$$\omega = \frac{v}{r}$$
## Linear Velocity
is tangential speed telling rate of change in straight.
$$v = \omega r$$
## Angular Acceleration (α)
Angular acceleration α is the rate of change of angular velocity over time.
$$\alpha=\frac{d\omega}{dt}$$
or we can use SUVAT to calculate it 
$$\alpha = \frac{\omega - \omega_0}{t}$$
$$\theta = \omega_0t+\frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2$$
$$\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha \theta$$
```
Change from a to alpha
s to theta

## Centripetal Acceleration
centripetal acceleration is the acceleration towards to the center of circular path to keep object moving in circle
**if there is no centripetal acceleration?**
- Without this acceleration, the object would fly off tangentially (Newton's 1st Law).
```
- Faster speed → harder to turn → more acceleration needed to stay in circle
- Smaller radius → tighter turn → more acceleration needed
```
$$a = \frac{v\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}$$
and $\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}$ 
$$a = \omega v$$
and $\omega = \frac{v}{r}$ 
$$a = v \cdot\frac{v}{r}$$
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}r{}$$

# Cues
if object not moving along circular path but have the centripetal acceleration it's still call circular motion?
Ans No, it's not circular motion e.g. spiral motion
What is the different of angular velocity and linear velocity
Ans
