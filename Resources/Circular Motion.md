# Circular Motion
is a motion of object moving rotating along circular path
## Properties of circle
- Circle has 360 = 2Ï€ rad
- Time use 1 round = period (T)
- $f = \frac{1}{T}$
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$

## Angular Displacement
is an angle turn by rotating object per time

$$\theta = \frac{s}{r}$$
## Angular Velocity
is rate of change in angular displacement call $\omega$ 
$$s = r\theta$$
derivative of s = v 
$$\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{d\theta}{dt} \cdot r\theta$$
which is $\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \omega$ 



# Cues
if object not moving along circular path but have the centripetal acceleration it's still call circular motion?
