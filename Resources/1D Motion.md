# 1D Motion
1D motion refer to the change in position or orientation of a body over time. if in x and y it's call 2D, 3D if (there are 3 axis) motion.

## Wording
**Speed** -> is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time. It is a scalar quantity

$$\frac{Distance}{Time}$$

**Velocity** -> on the other hand, refers to the rate of change of displacement, which includes both magnitude and direction. It is a vector quantity,

$$\frac{Displacement}{Time}$$

**Distance**Â -> is the total length of the path traveled by an object, regardless of direction. It is a scalar quantity

- **Displacement** -> is the shortest straight-line distance from the initial position to the final position of an object.
