# 1D Motion
1D motion refer to the change in position or orientation of a body over time. if in x and y it's call 2D, 3D if (there are 3 axis) motion.

## Velocity
Speed vs Velocity
**Speed** -> is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time. It is a scalar quantity

$$\frac{Distance}{Time}$$

**Velocity** -> on the other hand, refers to the rate of change of displacement, which includes both magnitude and direction. It is a vector quantity,

$$\frac{Displacement}{Time}$$

Distance vs Displacement
**Distance** -> is the total length of the path traveled by an object, regardless of direction. It is a scalar quantity
**Displacement** -> is the shortest straight-line distance from the initial position to the final position of an object.
$$v= \frac{s}{t}m/s$$

Example of Displacement over time graph 
where I can find the velocity by find the slope 
## Acceleration
V -> A -> **Accerate**
V <- A -> **Delay**
$$a = \frac{v}{t} m/s^2$$
## Turning Points
Is the point where v = 0

### Graph Explaination
where v = 0 means x is return
where a is 
```
a under line = -a 
a above line = +a
v underline = -v
v aboveline = +v
```

## Motion Graph

### Position-Time Graph
- **Slope**: Represents velocity (V).
- **Area**: Not directly applicable or meaningful.
- **Formula**: $V=\frac{ΔX}{Δt}$​ (change in position over time).

### Velocity-Time Graph

- **Slope**: Represents acceleration (a).
- **Area**: Represents change in position $\Delta X$.
- **Formula**: $s=v⋅t$ (displacement as velocity times time).

### Acceleration-Time Graph

- **Slope**: Not provided (typically jerk in physics).
- **Area**: Represents change in velocity $\Delta V$.
- **Formula**: $\Delta V = at$ (change in velocity as acceleration times time).

# Cues
**Explain the relationship of the motion graph?**
**ANS** Distance Graph where it's turning back is where v = 0 (turning point) on Velocity when v = 0 is where velocity start negative and if the velocity is constant distance still increasing finally Acceleration Graph when v is constant a = 0 if v is increase there are the acceleration .

**Why Acceleration graph is square?**
**ANS** This is for constant acceleration.

# Summary
```
When an object moves in one dimension, its motion is described by the equation s = vt. This can be shown in a motion time graph, and there are certain relationships between them e.g. where turning point is where the v = 0.
```
$$v = \frac{s}{t}$$
$$a = \frac{v}{t}$$
