# 1D Motion
1D motion refer to the change in position or orientation of a body over time. if in x and y it's call 2D, 3D if (there are 3 axis) motion.

## Velocity
Speed vs Velocity
**Speed** -> is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time. It is a scalar quantity

$$\frac{Distance}{Time}$$

**Velocity** -> on the other hand, refers to the rate of change of displacement, which includes both magnitude and direction. It is a vector quantity,

$$\frac{Displacement}{Time}$$

Distance vs Displacement
**Distance**Â -> is the total length of the path traveled by an object, regardless of direction. It is a scalar quantity
**Displacement** -> is the shortest straight-line distance from the initial position to the final position of an object.
$$v= \frac{s}{t}m/s$$

Example of Displacement over time graph 
where I can find the velocity by find the slope 
## Acceleration
V -> A -> **Accerate**
V <- A -> **Delay**
$$a = \frac{v}{t} m/s^2$$
## Turning Points
Is the point where v = 0

### Graph Explaination
where v = 0 means x is return
where a is 
a under line = -a 
a above line = +a
v underline = -v
v aboveline = +v
