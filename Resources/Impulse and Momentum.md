# Impulse and Momentum
## Momentum
Momentum means Motion capability of the object Which is equal to the product between the mass and the speed of the object Mass
$$p = mv$$
there is relation to kinetics energy we know
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
p = mv thus
$$KE = \frac{p^2}{2m}$$
## Impulse
the change in momentum of an object when a force acts on it over a period of time. 
$$\Delta P = P_1 - P_2$$
$$\Delta P = mv_1 - mv_2$$
## Impact Force
Impact force is the actual force from collision
$$\Sigma F = ma$$
we know that $a = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t}$ 
$$\Sigma F = m(\frac{v_2-v_1}{t})$$
and p = mv
$$\Sigma F = \frac{\Delta P}{t}$$
## Conversation of momentum
if there is not external force the summation of momentum on system is constant
$$\Sigma P_{before} = \Sigma P_{after}$$

## Collision

### Elastic collision
$$\Sigma E_{k1} = \Sigma E_{k2}$$
### Inelastic collision
$$\Sigma E_{k1} \neq \Sigma E_{k2}$$
because there is energy loss e.g. sound heat 
Energy loss = $E_1 - E_2$ 
#### Perfectly Inelastic Collision

#### Partially Inelastic Collision

## Coefficient Of Restitution
The **coefficient of restitution (COR)** is a measure of how elastic a collision is between two bodies.
- **e=1**: This indicates a **perfectly elastic collision**, where no kinetic energy is lost, and the objects rebound with the same speed they approached each other.
- **e=0**: This represents a **perfectly inelastic collision**, where the objects do not rebound at all and stick together after the impact.
$$v = eu$$
to find e
$$e = \frac{v'_2 - v'_1}{v_2-v_1}$$
and another way
$$e = \frac{v_1}{v_2}$$
from $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ => $v = \sqrt{2gh}$ 
$$e = \frac{\sqrt{2gh_1}}{\sqrt{2gh_2}}$$
2, g cancel
$$e = \sqrt{\frac{Rebound Height}{Drop Height}}$$

# Summary
```
Momentum and impulse is about collision momentum is p = mv and can transform to KE impluse and Impact force finally collision there are elastic collision is no energy loss and inelastic collision with energy loss inside the inelastic collision there are perfectly and partilly inelastic collision which is perfectly stick together but partilly is not and how to
