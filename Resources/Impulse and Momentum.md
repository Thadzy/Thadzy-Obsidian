# Impulse and Momentum
## Momentum
Momentum meansÂ Motion capability of the object Which is equal to the product between the mass and the speed of the object Mass
$$p = mv$$
there is relation to kinetics energy we know
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
p = mv thus
$$KE = \frac{p^2}{2m}$$
## Impulse
the change in momentum of an object when a force acts on it over a period of time. 
$$\Delta P = P_1 - P_2$$
$$\Delta P = mv_1 - mv_2$$
## Impact Force
Impact force is the actual force from collision
$$\Sigma F = ma$$
we know that $a = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t}$ 
$$\Sigma F = m(\frac{v_2-v_1}{t})$$
and p = mv
$$\Sigma F = \frac{\Delta P}{t}$$
## Conversation of momentum
if there is not external force the summation of momentum on system is constant
$$\Sigma P_{before} = \Sigma P_{after}$$

## Collision

### Elastic collision
$$\Sigma E_{k1} = \Sigma E_{k2}$$
### Inelastic collision
$$\Sigma E_{k1} \neq \Sigma E_{k2}$$
because there is energy loss e.g. sound heat 
Energy loss = $E_1 - E_2$
