# SUVAT
SUVAT is the set of motion equation use when a is constant
How it come from
## v = u + at
$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ which means, $a = \frac{u-v}{t}$ 
format the equation
$$v = u +at$$

## s = (u+v/2)t

$s = vt$
average velocity and this is trapezoid area foumular
$$s = \frac{(u+v)}{2}t$$
## S = ut + 1/2at^2
now we have $v = u + at$ and $s = \frac{1}{2}(u+v)t$ 
substitute v to s
