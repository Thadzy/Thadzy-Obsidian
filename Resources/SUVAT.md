# SUVAT
SUVAT is the set of motion equation use when a is constant
How it come from
## v = u + at
$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ which means, $a = \frac{u-v}{t}$ 
format the equation
$$v = u +at$$

## s = (u+v/2)t

$s = vt$
average velocity and this is trapezoid area foumular
$$s = \frac{(u+v)}{2}t$$
## S = ut + 1/2at^2
now we have $v = u + at$ and $s = \frac{1}{2}(u+v)t$ 
substitute v to s 
$s = \frac{1}{2}(u+u+at)t$ format it
$$s = ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$ or we can integrate it 
$$s = \int (u + at)dt$$
## v^2 = u^2 + 2as
now we have $v = u + at$ and $s = \frac{1}{2}(u+v)t$ 
$t = \frac{v-u}{a}$ substitute to s
