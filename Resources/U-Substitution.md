# U-Substitution
u-Substitution essentially reverses the chain rule for derivatives
```
Derivative (with chain rule) : multiply by derivative
Integrate (with u-sub) : divide by derivative
```
e.g.
![[Pasted image 20250628171712.png]]
Step is
1. Find u 
2. Derivative u = f(x) dx
3. dx = something du and Substitution to f(x)
# Cues
Why I have to derivative u in u-substitution?
# Summary
