# U-Substitution
u-Substitution essentially reverses the chain rule for derivatives
```
Derivative (with chain rule) : multiply by derivative
Integrate (with u-sub) : divide by derivative
```
e.g.

Step is
1. Find u 
2. Derivative u = f(x) dx
3. dx = something du and Substitution to f(x)
# Cues
**Why I have to derivative u in u-substitution?**
**Ans** The change in y with respect to x depends not just on how fast f changes with u, but also how fast u changes with x.
In **integration**, u-substitution helps **simplify** an expression. When we set $u = g(x)$, we have to change **everything** to terms of $u$, including $dx$, which becomes:

$$

du = g'(x) dx \Rightarrow dx = \frac{du}{g'(x)}

$$
# Summary
```
U-subsitution is use when reverse chain rule
1. Find u 
2. Derivative u = f(x) dx
3. dx = something du and Substitution to f(x)
```
