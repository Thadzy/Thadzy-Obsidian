# Projectile Motion
A projectile is any object thrown into space upon which the only acting force is gravity.
**there are two simultaneous independent rectilinear motions** when we calculation projectile motion we have to resolution of forces to x, y

and change from a to g

## X-axis (Horizontal)
there is no accelerate we can use $$v_x = \frac{s_x}{t}$$ and x is constant
## Y-axis (Vertical)
there is gravity (g) so we have to use SUVAT 
## Interesting Information
1. Farthest Angle is 45 degree
2. CO angle e.g. 30,60 37,53 is give the same x-displacement

# Cues
**if there are only gravity force act on projectile object how it can move forward?**
**Ans**
