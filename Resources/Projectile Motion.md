# Projectile Motion
A projectile is any object thrown into space upon which the only acting force is gravity.
**there are two simultaneous independent rectilinear motions** when we calculation projectile motion we have to resolution of forces to x, y

and change from a to g

## X-axis (Horizontal)
there is no accelerate we can use $$v_x = \frac{s_x}{t}$$ and x is constant
## Y-axis (Vertical)
there is gravity (g) so we have to use SUVAT and at Maximum height v = 0
## Interesting Information
1. Farthest Angle is 45 degree
2. CO angle e.g. 30,60 37,53 is give the same x-displacement
## Additional Formular
### Total time of flight
$u_x = ucos\theta$ 
$u_y = usin\theta$ 
at the end of the flight is $S_y = 0$
$$S_y = u_yt - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
$$0 = (usin\theta)t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
$$T = \frac{2usin\theta}{g}$$
### Horizontal Range


# Cues
**if there are only gravity force act on projectile object how it can move forward?**
**Ans** Because of initial forward velocity (inertia) goes in horizontal direction and gravity just made in goes downwards.
# Summary
```
Projectile Motion is motion in x,y axis which x is no g but y is so we have to use SUVAT and only the force that act on the porjectile is only gravity
