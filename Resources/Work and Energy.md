# Work and Energy
**Work** is defined as transferring energy into an object so that there is some displacement. **Energy** is defined as the ability to do work.
$$W = Fd$$

## Kinetic energy
the energy an object possesses due to its motion
$$\Sigma F = ma, a = \frac{dv}{dt}$$Therefore but the problem is in equation has x,v,t 
Use chain rule
$$\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dx}v$$

$$F_{ll} = mv\frac{dv}{dx}$$
