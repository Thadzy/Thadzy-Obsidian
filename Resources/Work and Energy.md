# Work and Energy
**Work** is defined as transferring energy into an object so that there is some displacement. **Energy** is defined as the ability to do work.
## Work
$$W = F \cdot s (J)$$

if F, s going to the same direction = +w
else if opposite direction = -w
else if F and s perpendicular w = 0
## Power
is rate of work can do in 1 unit of time
$$P = \frac{W}{t}$$



# Cues
Why F and s perpendicular make w = 0?
Ans?
# Summary
