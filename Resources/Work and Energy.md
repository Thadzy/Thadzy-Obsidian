# Work and Energy
Work is defined as transferring energy into an object so that there is some displacement. 
## Work
$$W = F \cdot s (J)$$

if F, s going to the same direction = +w
else if opposite direction = -w
else if F and s perpendicular w = 0
## Power
How much work can be done in a single unit of time
how fast is the work works?
$$P = \frac{W}{t}$$
there is unit call Horsepower (HP)
$$1 HP = 746 Watt$$
## Energy
Energy is the ability within an object that allows it to move without **external force acting on it.**
### Kinetics Energy
kinetics Energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion

From Newton's laws
$$F = ma$$
But acceleration is not directly in terms of position x, so we rewrite using the chain rule
$$\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dx}v$$
$$F = mv\frac{dv}{dx}$$
Plug into the Work Equation
$$W = \int F \,dx = \int mv\frac{dv}{dx} \, dx$$
dx is gone
$$W = \int mv dv$$
and integrate from 0 to any v
$$W = m \int_0^vvdv = m[\frac{1}{2}v^2]_0^v=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
### Gravitational Potential Energy
Gravitational potential energy is energy an object possesses due to its position within a gravitational field in the object ready to fall
in vertical
$$F_y = -mg$$
integrate force over height
$$W = \int_{h_1}^{h_2}(-mg)dy = -mg(h_1-h_2)$$
$$E_p = mgh$$
### Potential Energy of Spring
the potential energy stored as a result of the deformation of a particular elastic object, or a spring.
**Hooke's Law**
$$F = -kx$$
we integrate
$$W = \int_0^x-kx\,dx$$
$$W = -\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
```
Integrate F respect to X we got work W
