# Work and Energy
**Work** is defined as transferring energy into an object so that there is some displacement. **Energy** is defined as the ability to do work.

$F_{ll}$ = Rate of change of movement
$F_{c}$ = Supporting objects

$$\Sigma F = ma, a = \frac{dv}{dt}$$

Therefore but the problem is in equation has x,v,t

$$F_{ll} = m\frac{dv}{dt}$$

Use chain rule

$$\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dx}v$$

$$F_{ll} = mv\frac{dv}{dx}$$

Integrate

$$\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_{ll}dx = \int_{u}^{v}mv dv$$

$$\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_{ll}dx = \frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2$$
