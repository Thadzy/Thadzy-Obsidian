# Work and Energy
Work is defined as transferring energy into an object so that there is some displacement. 
## Work
$$W = F \cdot s (J)$$

if F, s going to the same direction = +w
else if opposite direction = -w
else if F and s perpendicular w = 0
## Power
How much work can be done in a single unit of time
how fast is the work works?
$$P = \frac{W}{t}$$
there is unit call Horsepower (HP)
$$1 HP = 746 Watt$$
## Energy
The ability within an object that allows it to move without external force acting on it.


# Cues
Why F and s perpendicular make w = 0?
Ans?
