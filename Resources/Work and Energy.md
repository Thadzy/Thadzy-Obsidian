# Work and Energy
Work is defined as transferring energy into an object so that there is some displacement. 
## Work
$$W = F \cdot s (J)$$

if F, s going to the same direction = +w
else if opposite direction = -w
else if F and s perpendicular w = 0
## Power
How much work can be done in a single unit of time
how fast is the work works?
$$P = \frac{W}{t}$$
there is unit call Horsepower (HP)
$$1 HP = 746 Watt$$
## Energy
Energy is the ability within an object that allows it to move without **external force acting on it.**
### Kinetics Energy
kinetics Energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion
From Newton's laws
$$F = ma$$
But acceleration is not directly in terms of position x, so we rewrite using the chain rule
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$


# Cues
Why F and s perpendicular make w = 0?
Ans?
