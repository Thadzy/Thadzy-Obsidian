# Work and Energy
**Work** is defined as transferring energy into an object so that there is some displacement. **Energy** is defined as the ability to do work.
$$W = F \cdot s (J)$$

if F, s going to the same direction = +w
else if opposite direction = -w
else if F and s perpendicular w = 0
# Cues
Why F and s perpendicular
