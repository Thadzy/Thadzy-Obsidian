# Limit
limit is the value a function approaches as its input a certain point.

```
To check that limit actually have the value 
```
## Types of dots in graph
- open dots represent values that are not included in the function's domain.
- closed dots represent values that are included.
$$\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = f(a)$$
How to solve the limit
- Direct substitution
- Factoring
- Conjugate
# Cues
Why this 3 method is works in limit?
Ans 
1. Direct substitution Works for continuous functions — value at a point equals the limit.
2. Factoring Removes common zero-causing terms, revealing actual behavior near the point.
3. Removes square roots causing 0/0​, using valid algebraic identities.
