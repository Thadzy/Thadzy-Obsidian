# Integration
## Anti-derivative
anti-derivative is the way to integrate goal is to find before form of the function
e.g. 2x anti-derivative is 2x^2/2 
$$2x => \frac{2x^2}{2}=>x^2$$
but what happened if anti-derivative of $x^{-1}$ 
$$x^{-1} => \frac{x^0}{0}$$
not works but in logarithms we know that 
$$f'(x) \frac{1}{x} = \ln$$
