# Integration
## Anti-derivative
anti-derivative is the way to integrate goal is to find before form of the function
e.g. 2x anti-derivative is 2x^2/2 
$$2x => \frac{2x^2}{2}=>x^2$$
but what happened if anti-derivative of $x^{-1}$ 
$$x^{-1} => \frac{x^0}{0}$$
not works but in logarithms we know that 
$$f'(x) \frac{1}{x} = \ln x$$
therefore 
$$x^{-1} = \ln |x|$$

## Integrate the function
e.g. $f(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 - 3x^2 + x$
and derivative them
$$8x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x + 1$$

x can be any value because it's constant therefore when integrate back I have + C 
and form the graph we know that when the maximum point is where the derivative = 0
## Area under the curve 
Why definite Integration = Area under curve?
e.g.

This is v-t graph and if we can find the area under the curve is displacement 
in integration we split them into the small rectangle which is
$$A = b \times h => dA = f(t)dt$$
format the equation
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = f(t)$$
and A(t) is area under curve and f(t) is slope which means
Derivative of A(t) = f(t)
when Anti-Derivative of f(t) is A(t) this is **why Integrate = Area under curve**.
## Definite Integrals
to know the area under the curve we have to know the definite 
$$\int_a^bf(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$$
but if there are negative value we have to split the integration
