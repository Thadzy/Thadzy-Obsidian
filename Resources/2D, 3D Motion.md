# 2D, 3D Motion
2D and 3D motion refer to the change in position or orientation of a body over time. Motion can be classified into different types, including translation motion. It also involves Vector to represent direction and includes concepts such as Circular Motion and Projectile Motion.
$$ v = \frac{d}{dt}r = \frac{d}{dt}(xi + yj) = \frac{d}{dt}(xi)+\frac{d}{dt}(yj)$$

$$= i\frac{dx}{dt}+ j \frac{dy}{dt} $$

$$ v = v_xi + v_yi $$

$$ v_x = \frac{dx}{dt}, v_y = \frac{dy}{dt}$$

$$v = \sqrt{v_i^2+v_j^2}$$

$$Î¸ = tan^{-1}(\frac{v_i}{v_j})$$
**Everything is similar to 1D motion but divided into calculations across 2 or 3 axes.**

# Summary
```
2D, 3D motion is like 1D motion but there are more dimension by using vector and represent the direction it goes in x,y,z axis
