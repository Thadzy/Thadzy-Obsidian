# Differentiation
Is the process to find the derivative.
## Constant Rule
y = 3

when x is constant there is no slope therefore dy/dx = 0
$$\frac{d}{dx}C = 0$$
## Power Rule
this is come from derivative definition it is not a magic 
$$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$$
## Product Rule
to find the small change of the square which means vice versa the function that multiplies together
$$[f \cdot g]' = f \cdot g' + f' \cdot g$$

## Trig Rule
why derivative sin = cos?
![[Pasted image 20250627133954.png]]
because when the theta changed in small to find the theta that already changed is 
$$sin (tiny angle) = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} = cos\theta= \frac{d(sin(\theta))}{d \theta}$$
and the Trig differentiation loop

we know that derivative of sin = cos it's step back for $\frac{\pi}{2} rad$ 
therefore from the image
derivative
$$sin\theta = cos\theta$$
$$cos\theta = -sin\theta$$
$$-sin\theta = -cos\theta$$
$$-cos\theta = sin\theta$$
## Chain Rule
use when it's is composite function -> another function embedded in functions
$$\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = \frac{df}{dg} \cdot \frac{dg}{dx} = \frac{df}{dx}$$
```
Derivertive Inside and Outside
```
## Quotient Rule
use when $\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$ 
$$\frac{d}{dx}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}f(x) \cdot g(x)^{-1}$$
use product rule
$$f(x) \cdot($$
# Cues
**Why I have to use chain rule?**
**Ans** when it has another function inside the function I can't derivative directly because it's not equal because another function is using that variable.
