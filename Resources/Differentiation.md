# Differentiation
Is the process to find the derivative.
## Constant Rule
y = 3

when x is constant there is no slope therefore dy/dx = 0
$$\frac{d}{dx}C = 0$$
## Power Rule
this is come from derivative definition it is not a magic 
$$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$$
## Product Rule
to find the small change of the square which means
$$[f \cdot g]' = f \cdot g' + f$$
