# Differentiation
Is the process to find the derivative.
## Constant Rule
y = 3

when x is constant there is no slope therefore dy/dx = 0
$$\frac{d}{dx}C = 0$$
## Power Rule
this is come from derivative definition it is not a magic 
$$\frac{d}{dx}X^n = $$
## Addition Rule
## Product Rule

# Cues
# Summary
