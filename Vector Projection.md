## Introduction 
is the process of projecting 1 vector onto another vector it helps to determine how much one vector lies in the direction of another there are 2 types
## Scalar Projection
Components of one vector along another
Ex. Components of vector A along vector B

$$ Comp_B(A) = \frac{AB}{|B|} $$

## Vector Projection
$$ proj_B(A) = \frac{AB}{|B|^2}B $$
