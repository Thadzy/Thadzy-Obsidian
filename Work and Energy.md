In physics, **work** refers to the energy transferred to or from an object when a force is applied to it

$F_{ll}$ = Rate of change of movement
$F_{c}$ = Supporting objects
$$\Sigma F = ma, a = \frac{dv}{dt}$$
Therefore but the problem is in equation has x,v,t
$$F_{ll} = m\frac{dv}{dt}$$
Use chain rule
$$\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dx}v$$
$$F_{ll} = mv\frac{dv}{dx}$$
Integrate
$$\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_{ll}dx = \int_{u}^{v}mv dv$$
$$\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_{ll}dx = \frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2$$
**Why chain rule is true?**
**Why I use only F_ll but not F_c**
**Why F_c doesn't make the kinetic energy**
- Forces that act perpendicular to the direction of motion do not do work on the object. Work is defined as:
    $$W=F⋅d⋅cos⁡(θ)W=F⋅d⋅cos(θ)$$
    
If θ=90∘θ=90∘, then cos⁡(90∘)=0cos(90∘)=0,

**N = ?**
*Ans* N = 0 because it's perpendicular with the movement or displacement at that moment
Work = 
$$\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_{ll}dx = \int- mgsin\alpha ds$$
$$-mg\Delta y$$
y = h there for $GPE = mgh$
**How the sin(alpha) come from**?
*Ans*

sin(alpha) = $\frac{dy}{ds}$
In physics, **work** refers to the energy transferred to or from an object when a force is applied to it
**How we know the system?**
*Ans*
**How many types of energy**
$$W = \Delta KE + \Delta GPE + \Delta EPE$$

$$w = \int_{0}^{x}-kxdx = -\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
depends on the extension distance from equilibrium is independent of the path of motion.
## Power
Power in physics is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred over time.
$$P(t) =\frac{dw}{dt}$$
Average power
$$P(t) =\frac{W}{\Delta t}$$
$$P = \frac{W}{t}=Fv$$
## Conservation of Energy
**Total Energy Conservation**: In a closed or isolated system, the sum of all forms of energy (kinetic, potential, thermal, etc.) remains constant. If energy is lost in one part of the system, it must be gained in another part, ensuring that the total energy remains unchanged

## Summary of Energy Transformation:
Throughout the entire motion:
- When rising: KE decreases → GPE increases.
- At the top: KE = 0 → GPE is maximum.
- When falling: GPE decreases → KE increases.
