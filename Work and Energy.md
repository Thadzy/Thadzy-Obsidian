#Physics 
In physics, **work** refers to the energy transferred to or from an object when a force is applied to it

$F_{ll}$ = Rate of change of movement
$F_{c}$ = Supporting objects
$$\Sigma F = ma, a = \frac{dv}{dt}$$
Therefore but the problem is in equation has x,v,t
$$F_{ll} = m\frac{dv}{dt}$$
Use chain rule
$$\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dx}v$$
$$F_{ll} = mv\frac{dv}{dx}$$
Integrate
$$\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_{ll}dx = \int_{u}^{v}mv dv$$
$$\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_{ll}dx = \frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2$$
**Why chain rule is true?**
**Why I use only F_ll but not F_c**
**Why F_c doesn't make the kinetic energy**

**N = ?**
*Ans* N = 0 because it's perpendicular with the movement or displacement at that moment
Work = 
$$\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_{ll}dx = \int- mgsin\alpha ds$$
$$-mg\Delta y$$
y = h there for $GPE = mgh$
**How the sin(alpha) come from**?
*Ans*

sin(alpha) = $\frac{dy}{ds}$
In physics, **work** refers to the energy transferred to or from an object when a force is applied to it
**How we know the system?**
*Ans*
**How many types of energy**
$$W = \Delta KE + \Delta GPE + \Delta EPE$$

$$w = \int_{0}^{x}-kxdx = -\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
depends on the extension distance from equilibrium is independent of the path of motion.
# Power
Power in physics is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred over time.
$$P(t) =\frac{dw}{dt}$$
Average power
$$P(t) =\frac{W}{\Delta t}$$
