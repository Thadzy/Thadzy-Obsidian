## Introduction 
![[Pasted image 20250414124931.png]]
$$ s(\tau) = \int_a^\tau|r'(\tau)|d\tau = \int_a^\tau\sqrt{[x'(\tau)]^2+[y'(\tau)]^2+[z'(\tau)]^2} dt $$
$$ \frac{ds}{dt} = |r'(t)| $$

If C is the Smooth curve
$$ r(s) = x(s)i+y(s)j+z(s)k $$
When s is the arc length parameter therefore
$$ |r'(s)|=1 $$
