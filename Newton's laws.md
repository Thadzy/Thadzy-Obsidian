## Introduction 

2 types of force is pull and push
1. If the Force net = 0 object still moving with constant velocity
2. Force net is all force = 0 
3. In vertical $mg = N$

Force net doesn't make object move but it is changing the state of motion of objects is **Momentum**
Force make velocity change and accerelation

## Definition of momentum
![[Pasted image 20241022231423.png]]
Force net  = Rate of change of momentum
# First law
$$\Sigma F = 0$$

**inertial frame of reference**.
Newton first law will be true in only inertial frame of reference 
the outside will N and f will make the moment and make the cup fall
## Second law
$$\Sigma F = ma$$
## Third law
$$Action = Reaction$$

Even through the different speed and different mass
