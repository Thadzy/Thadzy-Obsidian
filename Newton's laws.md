## Introduction 
are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. 

```
2 types of force is pull and push
```
1. If the Force net = 0 object still moving with constant velocity
2. Force net is all force = 0 
3. In vertical $mg = N$

Force net doesn't make object move but it is changing the state of motion of objects is [[Impulse and Momentum]]
Force make velocity change thus acceleration change
## Definition of momentum
```
Force net  = Rate of change of momentum
```
# First law
$$\Sigma F = 0$$

**inertial frame of reference**.
Newton's first law holds true only in an inertial frame of reference. External forces, such as NN (normal force) and ff (friction), create a moment that causes the cup to fall.
## Second law
$$\Sigma F = ma$$
## Third law
$$Action = Reaction$$

Even through the different speed and different mass
