## Introduction 
use derivative

$$ r'(t) = \lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{r(t + \Delta t) -r(t)}{\Delta t} $$

<aside> ðŸ’¡

if |r(t)| â‰  0; |r(t)| is const when râ€™(t) âŠ¥ r(t) for every t

</aside>

## Smooth Curve
if r(t) is continuous and â‰  0 for every a â‰¤ t â‰¤ b â‡’ **Smooth Curve**
and we call curve C from r(t) is smooth curve
## Length of a space curve
we can find the length of curve C on [a, b]
$$ L = \int_a^b\sqrt{[x'(t)]^2+[y'(t)]^2+[z'(t)]^2} dt $$
$$ \int_a^b|r'(t)|dt $$
