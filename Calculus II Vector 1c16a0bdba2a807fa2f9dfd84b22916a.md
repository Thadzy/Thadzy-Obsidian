Why unit vector = 1?

$|\hat{v}| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\right)^2}$

simplify this

$|\hat{v}| = \sqrt{\frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}} = \sqrt{1} = 1$

is the process of projecting 1 vector onto another vector it helps to determine how much one vector lies in the direction of another  there are 2 types

## Scalar Projection

Components of one vector along another

Ex. Components of vector A along vector B

$$
Comp_B(A) = \frac{AB}{|B|}
$$

## Vector Projection

# 11. Straight line in 3D coordinate system

Give the line L pass the point $P_0(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ and parallel with the vector v

![image.png](Calculus%20II%20Vector%201c16a0bdba2a807fa2f9dfd84b22916a/image%2011.png)

Therefore,  every point in P(x,y,z) on line L will have the real number t that makes :

$$
P_0P = tv
$$

- $P_0P$  is the distance between $P_0$  to any P
- v give the direction of the line
- t is the scalar

$$
or (x-x_0,y-y_0,z-z_0)=(ta,tb,tc)
$$

Pipeline

1. Start at Point $P_0$
2. Vector v shows which way it goes
3. By scaling t to v to make it reach the point $P_0$

use to describe the path of an object

$$

$$

- v is the direction vector of line L
- a,b,c is the direction number

we call the equation of L in

$$
\frac{x-x_0}{a}=\frac{y-y_0}{b}=\frac{z-z_0}{c}

**Position vector concept**

$$
P_0P
$$

**Perpendicularity Condition**
